# JsJVM: Web Based Implementation of The JVM

## Week 1

### High level components

Roughly speaking, the JVm is split into 4 areas:

1. Class Loader: loads the class files into memory. does the linking + verification as well.
2. Execution Engine: executes the bytecode. contains the interpreter, JIT compiler, hotspot profiler etc.
3. Native Interface: interface to native dlls to call native methods.
4. Runtime Data Area: contains the stack, heap, etc.
