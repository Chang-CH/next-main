# Front end interview

## HTML

### `<script>`, `<script async>`, `<script defer>` differences

1. `<script>`: blocks html parsing, fetch and run script before resume.
2. `<script async>`: fetch and run script async. no guarantees on sequence, good for independent scripts e.g. analytics.
3. `<script defer>`: run after HTML parsed before `DOMContentLoaded`. deferred scripts run in sequence.

## CSS

Trivia:

- css `float`: allows texts to wrap around blocks a la newspapers.

### Box model

CSS box model is a box that wraps around every HTML element. It consists of: margins, borders, padding, and the actual content.

1. Content - The content of the box, where text and images appear
2. Padding - Clears an area around the content. The padding is transparent
3. Border - A border that goes around the padding and content
4. Margin - Clears an area outside the border. The margin is transparent

When setting the height and width of an element, you set the **CONTENT** dimensions.

### Display

1. `inline`: element will not start on a new line. Does not fill space. width and height do not work, element size is based on content.
2. `block`: element will start on a new line. Fills width. width and height work.
3. `inline-block`: inline but can set width and height.
4. `none`: element is removed from page, occupies no space. `visibility: hidden` is similar but element still takes up space.
5. `table`, `table-row`, `table-cell`: replicates the html table, `tr`, `td` elements.
6. `flex`: flexbox layout, see below.
7. `grid`: grid layout, like flex, more advanced.
8. `initial`, `inherit`: default value, inherit from parent respectively.

Display flex:

1. container: `flex`/`inline-flex`, changes if it is inline.
2. `flex-direction`: row or column
3. `flex-wrap`: wrap or nowrap, breaks to newline
4. `justify-content`: aligns items along main axis (see flex direction)
   - `flex-start`, `center`, `end`: left center right.
   - `space-between`: 1st item at start, last at end, space evenly distributed.
   - `space-around`: 1 unit of space between container and item, 2 unit between items.
   - `space-evenly`: 2 units space between item and item/container.
5. `align-items`: aligns items along cross axis (perpendicular to flex direction)
6. `align-content`: justify content for the cross axis, for lines.
7. `flex-grow`: relative space an element takes, 2 means takes twice of other elements.

Display grid:

1. `grid-template-rows` (+ columns): e.g. `1fr 20% 30px`, 1st column is 1 unit, second 20% etc. fr is similar to flex grow.
2. `column-gap`, `row-gap`: gap between columns/rows.
3. `justify-items`, `align-items`: start, center, stretch, end for row / column direction respectively.
4. `justify-content`, `align-content`: start, center, stretch, end for the entire grid (if smaller than parent).
5. `grid-auto-rows` (+ columns): sets default width/height of rows/columns.
6. `grid-auto-flow`: auto placement algo, `row` fills row `column` self explanatory. `dense`, if different size, try to minimise empty cells.
7. `grid-row`, `grid-column`: `1/3` means start at row 1, end at row 3 (2 units long).

### Media Queries Responsive Design

Wrap around classes, like an if else selector for screen size, orientation etc.

```css
@media (min-width: 50em) {
  article {
    column-count: 2; // have 2 columns of text if width > 50em
  }
}
```

### Selectors

Note that these selectors can be combined, e.g. `p.test#demo` will select `<p id="demo" class="test">`.

1. element selector: `p {color: red;}`, general element
2. id selector: `#demo {color: red;}`, selects elements with demo id
3. class selector: `.demo {color: red;}`, selects elements with the demo class
4. universal selector: `* {color: red;}`, selects all elements
5. pseudo class selector: `p:first-child {color: red;}`, selects the first child of all p elements
   1. `:active` - Selects the active link
   2. `:hover` - Selects on mouse over
   3. `:visited` - Selects all visited links
   4. `:first-child` - Selects the first child element
6. pseudo element selector: `p::first-line` selects the first line of all p elements
   1. `a::after` - Insert something after the content of each `<p>` element.
7. ` ` descendant selector, `p span` selects all span elements inside p elements (regardless of nesting)
8. `>` child selector, `p > span` selects all span elements where the parent is a p element (direct child)
9. `+` adjacent sibling selector, `p + span` selects all span elements that are placed immediately after p elements (`<p/><span/>`)
10. `~` general sibling selector, `p ~ span` selects all span elements that are placed after (not before) p elements (`<p/><span/><span/>`)

```css
a::after {
  content: "click me";
}
```

```HTML
<!-- Code -->
<a>hello</a>
```

```HTML
<!-- Output -->
<a>hello ::after</a>
<!-- equals <a> hello click me</a> -->
```

    2.  `::before` - Insert something before the content of each `<p>` element
    3.  `::first-letter` - Selects the first letter of each `<p>` element
    4.  `::first-line` - Selects the first line of each `<p>` element
    5.  `::selection` - Selects the portion of an element that is selected by a user
    6.  `::marker` - Selects form elements with placeholder text

**Examples**

1. `p i`, selects all `<i>` elements inside `<p>` elements
2. `p i:first-child {color: red;}`, selects the first child of all `<i>` elements inside `<p>` elements

### Specificity

When 2 selectors apply to the same element, the one with higher specificity wins.

```css
#demo {
  color: blue;
}
.test {
  color: green;
}
p {
  color: red;
}
```

In this case, `<p id="demo" class="test" style="color: pink;">` will be pink, since specificity order =
(**inline style** > **id** > **class, pseudo class, attribute selectors** > **tag, elements, pseudo elements**)

### Collapsing margins + Block Formatting Context

- collapsing margin: 2 boxes 1 margin 10px 1 margin 15px, margin between the 2 is not 25px but 15px. Only happens when the 2 boxes are in the same BFC.
- new BFC also makes sure parent BFC size contains floating elements.
- fix this by shifting 1 into a new BFC, by: `overflow: hidden`, `float: none`, `position: absolute` etc. (recently: `display: flow-root;`, least side effects)

### Stacking context

- within a stacking context, elements are stacked according to their z-index relative to each other.
- stuff outside the context cannot appear in between layers in a stacking context.
- easiest way to create context, `position: relative/absolute` w/ `z-index: != auto`.

## JS

Random stuff:

- `for ... in` for object keys, `for ... of` for array values.
- `Proxy`: intercepts operations on objects, e.g. `get`, `set`. Example:

```js
const target = {
  msg1: "A",
  msg2: "B",
};

const handler = {
  get: function (obj, prop) {
    if (prop === "msg1") {
      return "C";
    }
    return Reflect.get(...arguments);
  },
};

const proxy = new Proxy(target, handler);
console.log(proxy.msg1); // C
console.log(proxy.msg2); // B
```

### This

Refers to the caller of a function, determined at **runtime**. Missing in arrow functions.
Can be bound ahead of time so `this` is fixed regardless of how its called.
Its value depends on the context in which it is called:

1. Function + object: `this` refers to the **object used** to call the function

```js
function get() {
  return this;
}
obj.func = get;
obj2.func = obj.func;
obj.func(); // obj
obj2.func(); // obj2
```

2. global: `this` is `undefined` in strict mode, `globalThis` in non strict, `window` in **browser**.
3. Callbacks: usually called directly `get()`, undefined.
4. Arrow functions: `this` is bound by closure to its context at creation (global scope, `globalThis`).
5. `super`: special case, `this` refers to the current object, not the parent `suepr` is pointing to.
6. constructor: `this` refers to the object returned by `new function()`.
7. derived constructor:`new Derived()`, `this` = `new Parent()`. constructor must return an object (overrides `this`), or call `super()` first.

### Var and Hoisting

variables (and functions) are either function scoped or global scoped. They are **NOT** block scoped.
Before any code runs, all variable and function declarations are hoisted to the top. Note that the initialization is not hoisted.

```js
console.log(a); // undefined
if (true) {
  var a = 1;
}
console.log(a); // 1, ignores block scope
function b() {
  var b = 2;
}
console.log(b); // ReferenceError, function scoped.
```

### Closures

- closure: a way for functions to access/modify variables outside of their body `const x = 1; function a() {console.log(x)}`. similar to `(() => this).bind(this)`.
- Created at function creation time.
- Closures hold reference to constants outside scope, even if outer scope destroyed the constant is not GC due to referenced count.
  - binding is less performant since it has additional checks as per the bind spec.
  - Can be used to make private variables: variable in outer scope can only be accessed in the function with closure.
- `bind(this, arg1, ...)`: method of `Function`. uses the provided `this` and arguments to create a new function. if 3 args, 1 arg provided by bind, call with remaining 2 args.

```js
function a() {
  // also possible with if blocks and const/let
  const x = 1;
  return function b() {
    console.log(x);
  };
}
a()(); // 1
```

### arrow vs function declaration

Stuff missing in arrows:

- `arguments`: built in constant, array of arguments, can be used anywhere in a function.
- `this`: constant, reference to object that called the function. if arrow function is declared in a class, `this` is bound via closure.

Due to arrows missing `this`, they are good candidates for callbacks which need the outer `this`, e.g. in `setTimeout`.
In addition:

- arrows cannot be used as constructors

```js
class C {
  a = 999;
  B() { return this.a;}
  C = () => this.a; // closure binds C's this
}
const {B, C} = new C();
C(); // 999, B() gives TypeError: this is undefined.

const obj = {
  a = 999;
  B() { return this.a;}
  C = () => this.a; // obj has no this for C to bind
}
B(); // 999, C() gives TypeError: this is undefined.
```

### JS promises

- syntax: `new Promise((resolve, reject) => {...})`, `Promise.resolve(value)`: factory method, returns a promise that resolves to value straight.

### Event loop

**Preamble**

- `setTimeout`, DOM, AJAX (Async Js And Xml) etc. are not in V8(JS) runtime, it is implemented in the browser API.
- JS is single threaded. rendering and logic occurs on the same stack.
- `async` functions are run as **SYNCHRONOUS** functions until the first await. each await + code after it is 1 microtask.
- `await` uses microtasks under the hood to resume execution.

**Components**

1. call stack: main stack of the JS thread. logic executes here.
2. callback (aka macrotasks) queue: contains event messages (`onClick`, `onLoad` etc.), also contains callbacks e.g. from `setTimeout`. `script` is also a macrotask.
3. microtasks queue: contains microtasks waiting to be run. includes `.then(cb)`, `await`, etc. only come from code.

**Rules**

1. task dequeued from macrotasks
2. task runs to completion (stack empty, script finished)
3. all microtasks run. if microtasks create new microtasks, also run.
4. render if necessary
5. run next macrotask/wait till new macrotask

**Example**

```js
setTimeout(() => console.log(1), 0);
Promise.resolve().then(() => console.log(2));
const b = async () => {
  console.log(5);
};
const a = async () => {
  await console.log(3);
  console.log(7);
  await setTimeout(() => console.log(8));
  console.log(9);
};
b();
a();
Promise.resolve().then(() => console.log(6));
console.log(4);
```

1. (step 0) `script` is in macrotask. stack is empty, `script` is pushed onto stack.

```js
setTimeout(() => console.log(1), 0);
```

2. `console.log(1)` added to macrotask queue.

```js
Promise.resolve().then(() => console.log(2));
```

3. `console.log(2)` added to microtask queue.

```js
b();
console.log(5);
```

4. `5` is logged. no await so runs synchronously.

```js
a();
await console.log(3);
```

5. `3` is logged, since the function is run synchronously. `await` resolution + `7` onwards added as microtask.

```js
Promise.resolve().then(() => console.log(6));
```

6. `console.log(6)` added to microtask queue.

```js
console.log(4);
```

7. `4` logged sync.

```js
microtasks = [() => console.log(2), () => {console.log(7); await ...}, () => console.log(6)]
```

8. main stack empty, script finished. run all microtasks. `2` is logged, then `7`.
9. `setTimeout(() => console.log(8));` is also run. returns a `timeoutID` (not a promise). `console.log(9)` (and previous await) added to microtask queue
10. `9` logged. no more microtasks. render once by browser.
11. dequeue macrotasks: `1`, `8`.

Due to the logic of the event loop, we get some phenomena:

- `setTimeout(cb, 0)`: 0 second timeouts, effectively just defers running cb until stack is clear.
- browser render can only happen when stack is clear, so slow code will cause browser to freeze.
- render has higher priority than callbacks, so if stack is empty render gets pushed onto stack before callback queue.
- processing large array sync, browser cannot render in between. `setTimeout(cb, 0)` for each element, render happens in between processing each element.
- `requestAnimationFrame(cb)` can be used to run `cb()` every frame instead of `setTimeout(1000/60)` to avoid extra render calculations
- `requestAnimationFrame` runs **BEFORE** render (safari + edge is after render): if we want to change something the next render frame, need 2 rAF.

```js
box.style.transform = "translateX(200px)"; // not rendered yet, transform = 200px
requestAnimationFrame(() => {
  box.style.transform = "translateX(100px)";
}); // not rendered yet.
// before render: run callback, transform = 100px
// render 100px in 1 frame, not 200px in 1 frame then 100px in next frame
```

### JQuery

Shorthand for DOM manipulation. e.g. `$("p").hide()` hides all `<p>` elements. Follows css selector syntax (including `[space]` descendant, `>`, `~` etc.)

- effects: `$("#demo").fadeIn()`, `$("#demo").hide()` etc.
- traversing: `$("#demo").parent()`, `$("#demo").children()` etc.
- DOM manipulation: `$("#demo").append("<p>hello</p>")`, `$("#demo").attr("href", "a.com")` etc.

### Variable issues: immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE) + Scoping

before ES2015 JS only had var, and var did not have block scope, only function scope (anywhere in the function where they were declared).
So to create a scope, we use IIFE.

```js
{
  let p = 110;
  var q = 111;
}
console.log(p); // reference error
console.log(q); // ok

(function () {
  var q = 111;
})(); // notice the brackets around the function, if not will not work.
console.log(q); // reference error

var a = 1;
let b = 1;
{
  var a = 2;
  let b = 2;
}
// a = 2, b = 1
```

This is because of var **hoisting**: a variable is hoisted (regardless of block scope) to the top of the function it is declared in.
This is why `console.log(x); var x = 10;` works (it prints undefined)

### Prototypal Inheritance

```js
function Parent(name) {
  this.name = name;
}

Parent.prototype.greet = function () {
  console.log("(P)Hello from " + this.name);
}; // const p = new Parent("name"); p.greet();

const child = Object.create(Parent.prototype);
// or child.prototype = Parent
child.name = "kid";
child.cry = () => console.log("AAA");
child.cry(); // AAA
child.greet(); // (P)Hello from kid
```

### Bubbling

- When an event happens on an element, that event is also passed to its parents.
- button in a div, onclick event bubbled to div also.
- `event.target` is element where the event actually happened.
- `event.stopPropagation` prevents this from happening.
- `event.preventDefault` does not stop bubbling. It is used for disabling default actions (e.g. toggling checkboxes)
- note that in react only 1 root event listener is used, events are passed to react components manually.


## A11Y rules

- if a `<div>` or `<span>` is interactable, add `tabIndex={0}` to properties, allows keyboard tab to focus.
- `aria-label="start button"` for interactive elements (on `input`, `button`, `a`, `img` etc.) to label text for tts.
- alt text for `img`.
- `aria-live`: for updates to stuff, e.g. blinking lights, tts will read. `assertive` = urgent, tts immediately. `polite` = tts after current tts finishes.
- `aria-hidden={true}`: hide from tts, e.g. constantly changing stuff.
