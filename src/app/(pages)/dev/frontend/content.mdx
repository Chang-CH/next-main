## CSS

### Box model

CSS box model is a box that wraps around every HTML element. It consists of: margins, borders, padding, and the actual content.

1. Content - The content of the box, where text and images appear
2. Padding - Clears an area around the content. The padding is transparent
3. Border - A border that goes around the padding and content
4. Margin - Clears an area outside the border. The margin is transparent

When setting the height and width of an element, you set the **CONTENT** dimensions.

### Selectors

Note that these selectors can be combined, e.g. `p.test#demo` will select `<p id="demo" class="test">`.

1. element selector: `p {color: red;}`, general element
2. id selector: `#demo {color: red;}`, selects elements with demo id
3. class selector: `.demo {color: red;}`, selects elements with the demo class
4. universal selector: `* {color: red;}`, selects all elements
5. pseudo class selector: `p:first-child {color: red;}`, selects the first child of all p elements
   1. `:active` - Selects the active link
   2. `:hover` - Selects on mouse over
   3. `:visited` - Selects all visited links
   4. `:first-child` - Selects the first child element
6. pseudo element selector: `p::first-line` selects the first line of all p elements
   1. `a::after` - Insert something after the content of each `<p>` element.

```css
a::after {
  content: "click me";
}
```

```HTML
<!-- Code -->
<a>hello</a>
```

```HTML
<!-- Output -->
<a>hello ::after</a>
<!-- equals <a> hello click me</a> -->
```

    2.  `::before` - Insert something before the content of each `<p>` element
    3.  `::first-letter` - Selects the first letter of each `<p>` element
    4.  `::first-line` - Selects the first line of each `<p>` element
    5.  `::selection` - Selects the portion of an element that is selected by a user
    6.  `::marker` - Selects form elements with placeholder text

**Examples**

1. `p i`, selects all `<i>` elements inside `<p>` elements
2. `p i:first-child {color: red;}`, selects the first child of all `<i>` elements inside `<p>` elements

### Specificity

When 2 selectors apply to the same element, the one with higher specificity wins.

```css
#demo {
  color: blue;
}
.test {
  color: green;
}
p {
  color: red;
}
```

In this case, `<p id="demo" class="test" style="color: pink;">` will be pink, since specificity order =
(**inline style** > **id** > **class, pseudo class, attribute selectors** > **tag, elements, pseudo elements**)

### Layouts

## JS

- closure: a way for functions to modify variables outside of their body. similar to `(() => this).bind(this)`.
  Closures hold reference to constants outside scope, even if outer scope destroyed the constant is not GC due to referenced count.
  - binding is less performant since it has additional checks as per the bind spec.
- `arguments`: built in constant, array of arguments, can be used anywhere in a function.
- `Proxy`: intercepts operations on objects, e.g. `get`, `set`. Example:

```js
const target = {
  msg1: "A",
  msg2: "B",
};

const handler = {
  get: function (obj, prop) {
    if (prop === "msg1") {
      return "C";
    }
    return Reflect.get(...arguments);
  },
};

const proxy = new Proxy(target, handler);
console.log(proxy.msg1); // C
console.log(proxy.msg2); // B
```

## React

### Event loop

### Document Object Model (DOM)

The DOM is a interface for HTML documents. It is not specific to JS.
It represents all objects in the page as `Node`s. Different `Node` have different `Element` type, e.g. table, form etc.
Elements can further implement other HTML interfaces, e.g. `HTMLElement`, `HTMLTableElement`, etc.
HTML elements can be manipulated through the DOM by editing the properties of the interface they implement.
Notable objects:

1. `window`, `window.onload` etc.
2. `document`, `document.getElementById()` etc.
3. `Element.innerHTML`, `HTMLElement.style` etc.

### Virtual DOM

[link](https://blog.logrocket.com/virtual-dom-react/)

Implementing react FC in raw JS, it might look like `() => <div><button/><button/></div>`. Now if we rerender the first button due to state change,
the second button will get rerendered also. Virtual DOM tackles this by determining what has changed and only updates the parts of the DOM that changed.

1. Initial Virtual DOM: React creates a replica of the actual DOM tree, from the root element all the way down.
2. Diffing (Reconciliation): say state changed. React does DFS to traverse the virtual DOM and compare it with the snapshot of the previous virtual DOM.
   It then creates a list of differences. Differences do not just mean dirty flag, i.e. if parent component classname changes the diff is only the classname,
   children is not automatically assumed to be diffed (it will check the child also).
3. Render: React used ReactDOM to update the actual DOM.

This has some problems:

1. Large DOM: very big blog with a clock at the top. Every second the clock updates, so every second React diffs the entire huge blog DOM tree.
   1. [No library]: make the clock a separate component, so only the clock is diffed with itself.
   2. [million js]: Block Virtual DOM, million does static analysis to identify dynamic parts, create an edit map. Only diff the dynamic parts.
2. Shared state: 2 deeply nested child components need to share the same state
   1. [No library]: prop drilling, pass the state down to the children, `useEffect` listen to prop change. Causes rerenders at every level.
   2. [No library]: context, create a provider at the top, `useContext` at the bottom. Causes rerenders of all children of context provider also.
      can `useMemo` static components to avoid this.
   3. [Redux]: single giant state store. actually uses context under the hood but is opimized so only updated components rerender (the context never changes).
   4. [recoil]: atoms and selectors. atoms = state, selectors listen to the atoms/other selectors, when upstream update selector updates
