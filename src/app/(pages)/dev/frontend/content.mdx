## CSS

### Box model

CSS box model is a box that wraps around every HTML element. It consists of: margins, borders, padding, and the actual content.

1. Content - The content of the box, where text and images appear
2. Padding - Clears an area around the content. The padding is transparent
3. Border - A border that goes around the padding and content
4. Margin - Clears an area outside the border. The margin is transparent

When setting the height and width of an element, you set the **CONTENT** dimensions.

### Display

1. `inline`: element will not start on a new line. Does not fill space. width and height do not work, element size is based on content.
2. `block`: element will start on a new line. Fills width. width and height work.
3. `inline-block`: inline but can set width and height.
4. `none`: element is removed from page, occupies no space. `visibility: hidden` is similar but element still takes up space.
5. `table`, `table-row`, `table-cell`: replicates the html table, `tr`, `td` elements.
6. `flex`: flexbox layout, see below.
7. `grid`: grid layout, like flex, more advanced.
8. `initial`, `inherit`: default value, inherit from parent respectively.

Display flex:

1. container: `flex`/`inline-flex`, changes if it is inline.
2. `flex-direction`: row or column
3. `flex-wrap`: wrap or nowrap, breaks to newline
4. `justify-content`: aligns items along main axis (see flex direction)
   - `flex-start`, `center`, `end`: left center right.
   - `space-between`: 1st item at start, last at end, space evenly distributed.
   - `space-around`: 1 unit of space between container and item, 2 unit between items.
   - `space-evenly`: 2 units space between item and item/container.
5. `align-items`: aligns items along cross axis (perpendicular to flex direction)
6. `align-content`: justify content for the cross axis, for lines.
7. `flex-grow`: relative space an element takes, 2 means takes twice of other elements.

Display grid:

1. `grid-template-rows` (+ columns): e.g. `1fr 20% 30px`, 1st column is 1 unit, second 20% etc. fr is similar to flex grow.
2. `column-gap`, `row-gap`: gap between columns/rows.
3. `justify-items`, `align-items`: start, center, stretch, end for row / column direction respectively.
4. `justify-content`, `align-content`: start, center, stretch, end for the entire grid (if smaller than parent).
5. `grid-auto-rows` (+ columns): sets default width/height of rows/columns.
6. `grid-auto-flow`: auto placement algo, `row` fills row `column` self explanatory. `dense`, if different size, try to minimise empty cells.
7. `grid-row`, `grid-column`: `1/3` means start at row 1, end at row 3 (2 units long).

### Media Queries Responsive Design

Wrap around classes, like an if else selector for screen size, orientation etc.

```css
@media (min-width: 50em) {
  article {
    column-count: 2; // have 2 columns of text if width > 50em
  }
}
```

### Selectors

Note that these selectors can be combined, e.g. `p.test#demo` will select `<p id="demo" class="test">`.

1. element selector: `p {color: red;}`, general element
2. id selector: `#demo {color: red;}`, selects elements with demo id
3. class selector: `.demo {color: red;}`, selects elements with the demo class
4. universal selector: `* {color: red;}`, selects all elements
5. pseudo class selector: `p:first-child {color: red;}`, selects the first child of all p elements
   1. `:active` - Selects the active link
   2. `:hover` - Selects on mouse over
   3. `:visited` - Selects all visited links
   4. `:first-child` - Selects the first child element
6. pseudo element selector: `p::first-line` selects the first line of all p elements
   1. `a::after` - Insert something after the content of each `<p>` element.
7. ` ` descendant selector, `p span` selects all span elements inside p elements (regardless of nesting)
8. `>` child selector, `p > span` selects all span elements where the parent is a p element (direct child)
9. `+` adjacent sibling selector, `p + span` selects all span elements that are placed immediately after p elements (`<p/><span/>`)
10. `~` general sibling selector, `p ~ span` selects all span elements that are placed after (not before) p elements (`<p/><span/><span/>`)

```css
a::after {
  content: "click me";
}
```

```HTML
<!-- Code -->
<a>hello</a>
```

```HTML
<!-- Output -->
<a>hello ::after</a>
<!-- equals <a> hello click me</a> -->
```

    2.  `::before` - Insert something before the content of each `<p>` element
    3.  `::first-letter` - Selects the first letter of each `<p>` element
    4.  `::first-line` - Selects the first line of each `<p>` element
    5.  `::selection` - Selects the portion of an element that is selected by a user
    6.  `::marker` - Selects form elements with placeholder text

**Examples**

1. `p i`, selects all `<i>` elements inside `<p>` elements
2. `p i:first-child {color: red;}`, selects the first child of all `<i>` elements inside `<p>` elements

### Specificity

When 2 selectors apply to the same element, the one with higher specificity wins.

```css
#demo {
  color: blue;
}
.test {
  color: green;
}
p {
  color: red;
}
```

In this case, `<p id="demo" class="test" style="color: pink;">` will be pink, since specificity order =
(**inline style** > **id** > **class, pseudo class, attribute selectors** > **tag, elements, pseudo elements**)

### Layouts

## JS

Random stuff:

- `Proxy`: intercepts operations on objects, e.g. `get`, `set`. Example:

```js
const target = {
  msg1: "A",
  msg2: "B",
};

const handler = {
  get: function (obj, prop) {
    if (prop === "msg1") {
      return "C";
    }
    return Reflect.get(...arguments);
  },
};

const proxy = new Proxy(target, handler);
console.log(proxy.msg1); // C
console.log(proxy.msg2); // B
```

### This

Refers to the caller of a function, determined at **runtime**. Missing in arrow functions.
Can be bound ahead of time so `this` is fixed regardless of how its called.
Its value depends on the context in which it is called:

1. Function + object: `this` refers to the **object used** to call the function

```js
function get() {
  return this;
}
obj.func = get;
obj2.func = obj.func;
obj.func(); // obj
obj2.func(); // obj2
```

2. Function: If called directly `get()`, `this` is `undefined` in strict mode, `globalThis` in non strict
3. Callbacks: usually called directly `get()`, undefined.
4. Arrow functions: `this` is bound by closure to its context at creation (global scope, `globalThis`).
5. `super`: special case, `this` refers to the current object, not the parent `suepr` is pointing to.
6. constructor: `this` refers to the object returned by `new`.
7. derived constructor:`new Derived()`, `this` = `new Parent()`. constructor must return an object (overrides `this`), or call `super()` first.

### Var and Hoisting

variables (and functions) are either function scoped or global scoped. They are **NOT** block scoped.
Before any code runs, all variable and function declarations are hoisted to the top. Note that the initialization is not hoisted.

```js
console.log(a); // undefined
if (true) {
  var a = 1;
}
console.log(a); // 1, ignores block scope
function b() {
  var b = 2;
}
console.log(b); // ReferenceError, function scoped.
```

### Closures

- closure: a way for functions to access/modify variables outside of their body `const x = 1; function a() {console.log(x)}`. similar to `(() => this).bind(this)`.
- Created at function creation time.
- Closures hold reference to constants outside scope, even if outer scope destroyed the constant is not GC due to referenced count.
  - binding is less performant since it has additional checks as per the bind spec.
  - Can be used to make private variables: variable in outer scope can only be accessed in the function with closure.

```js
function a() {
  // also possible with if blocks and const/let
  const x = 1;
  return function b() {
    console.log(x);
  };
}
a()(); // 1
```

### arrow vs function declaration

Stuff missing in arrows:

- `arguments`: built in constant, array of arguments, can be used anywhere in a function.
- `this`: constant, reference to object that called the function. if arrow function is declared in a class, `this` is bound via closure.

Due to arrows missing `this`, they are good candidates for callbacks which need the outer `this`, e.g. in `setTimeout`.
In addition:

- arrows cannot be used as constructors

```js
class C {
  a = 999;
  B() { return this.a;}
  C = () => this.a; // closure binds C's this
}
const {B, C} = new C();
C(); // 999, B() gives TypeError: this is undefined.

const obj = {
  a = 999;
  B() { return this.a;}
  C = () => this.a; // obj has no this for C to bind
}
B(); // 999, C() gives TypeError: this is undefined.
```

### Event loop

**Preamble**

- `setTimeout`, DOM, AJAX (Async Js And Xml) etc. are not in V8(JS) runtime, it is implemented in the browser API.
- JS is single threaded. rendering and logic occurs on the same stack.
- `async` functions are run as **SYNCHRONOUS** functions until the first await. each await + code after it is 1 microtask.
- `await` uses microtasks under the hood to resume execution.

**Components**

1. call stack: main stack of the JS thread. logic executes here.
2. callback (aka macrotasks) queue: contains event messages (`onClick`, `onLoad` etc.), also contains callbacks e.g. from `setTimeout`. `script` is also a macrotask.
3. microtasks queue: contains microtasks waiting to be run. includes `.then(cb)`, `await`, etc. only come from code.

**Rules**

1. task dequeued from macrotasks
2. task runs to completion (stack empty, script finished)
3. all microtasks run. if microtasks create new microtasks, also run.
4. render if necessary
5. run next macrotask/wait till new macrotask

**Example**

```js
setTimeout(() => console.log(1), 0);
Promise.resolve().then(() => console.log(2));
const b = async () => {
  console.log(5);
};
const a = async () => {
  await console.log(3);
  console.log(7);
  await setTimeout(() => console.log(8));
  console.log(9);
};
b();
a();
Promise.resolve().then(() => console.log(6));
console.log(4);
```

1. (step 0) `script` is in macrotask. stack is empty, `script` is pushed onto stack.

```js
setTimeout(() => console.log(1), 0);
```

2. `console.log(1)` added to macrotask queue.

```js
Promise.resolve().then(() => console.log(2));
```

3. `console.log(2)` added to microtask queue.

```js
b();
console.log(5);
```

4. `5` is logged. no await so runs synchronously.

```js
a();
await console.log(3);
```

5. `3` is logged, since the function is run synchronously. `await` resolution + `7` onwards added as microtask.

```js
Promise.resolve().then(() => console.log(6));
```

6. `console.log(6)` added to microtask queue.

```js
console.log(4);
```

7. `4` logged sync.

```js
microtasks = [() => console.log(2), () => {console.log(7); await ...}, () => console.log(6)]
```

8. main stack empty, script finished. run all microtasks. `2` is logged, then `7`.
9. `setTimeout(() => console.log(8));` is also run. returns a `timeoutID` (not a promise). `console.log(9)` (and previous await) added to microtask queue
10. `9` logged. no more microtasks. render once by browser.
11. dequeue macrotasks: `1`, `8`.

Due to the logic of the event loop, we get some phenomena:

- `setTimeout(cb, 0)`: 0 second timeouts, effectively just defers running cb until stack is clear.
- browser render can only happen when stack is clear, so slow code will cause browser to freeze.
- render has higher priority than callbacks, so if stack is empty render gets pushed onto stack before callback queue.
- processing large array sync, browser cannot render in between. `setTimeout(cb, 0)` for each element, render happens in between processing each element.
- `requestAnimationFrame(cb)` can be used to run `cb()` every frame instead of `setTimeout(1000/60)` to avoid extra render calculations
- `requestAnimationFrame` runs **BEFORE** render (safari + edge is after render): if we want to change something the next render frame, need 2 rAF.

```js
box.style.transform = "translateX(200px)"; // not rendered yet, transform = 200px
requestAnimationFrame(() => {
  box.style.transform = "translateX(100px)";
}); // not rendered yet.
// before render: run callback, transform = 100px
// render 100px in 1 frame, not 200px in 1 frame then 100px in next frame
```

### JQuery

Shorthand for DOM manipulation. e.g. `$("p").hide()` hides all `<p>` elements. Follows css selector syntax (including `[space]` descendant, `>`, `~` etc.)

- effects: `$("#demo").fadeIn()`, `$("#demo").hide()` etc.
- traversing: `$("#demo").parent()`, `$("#demo").children()` etc.
- DOM manipulation: `$("#demo").append("<p>hello</p>")`, `$("#demo").attr("href", "a.com")` etc.

### Variable issues: immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE) + Scoping

before ES2015 JS only had var, and var did not have block scope, only function scope (anywhere in the function where they were declared).
So to create a scope, we use IIFE.

```js
{
  let p = 110;
  var q = 111;
}
console.log(p); // reference error
console.log(q); // ok

(function () {
  var q = 111;
})(); // notice the brackets around the function, if not will not work.
console.log(q); // reference error

var a = 1;
let b = 1;
{
  var a = 2;
  let b = 2;
}
// a = 2, b = 1
```

This is because of var **hoisting**: a variable is hoisted (regardless of block scope) to the top of the function it is declared in.
This is why `console.log(x); var x = 10;` works (it prints undefined)

### Prototypal Inheritance

```js
function Parent(name) {
  this.name = name;
}

Parent.prototype.greet = function () {
  console.log("(P)Hello from " + this.name);
}; // const p = new Parent("name"); p.greet();

const child = Object.create(Parent.prototype);
// or child.prototype = Parent
child.name = "kid";
child.cry = () => console.log("AAA");
child.cry(); // AAA
child.greet(); // (P)Hello from kid
```

## React

### Rendering

Causes rerenders:

1. `state` change: whole component rerenders including children components(**CHILDREN PROP WILL NOT RERENDER**)
2. `context` changes: all components that `useContext` it will rerender.

Does not cause rerenders:

1. `props` change: unless `useEffect` dependencies have it.

Preventing rerenders:

1. lifting state up: instead of wrapping expensive component, take in the component as children prop. children will not rerender.
   - Its called lifting state up as `ExpensiveChild2`, is owned by `root`, not `Parent`. `Parent` rerender will not affect it.

```js
//root.js
<Parent>
<ExpensiveChild2/>
</Parent>
// Parent.js
<div>
  <ExpensiveChild /> // rerenders when parent div rerenders
  {children} // does not rerender.
</div>
```

2. `React.memo`: `const ChildMemo = React.Memo(Child); <ChildMemo/>`, only rerenders if props change.
   - Can provide function to check if props changed: `React.Memo(Child, (prevProps, NextProps) => true)`

### Document Object Model (DOM)

The DOM is a interface for HTML documents. It is not specific to JS.
It represents all objects in the page as `Node`s. Different `Node` have different `Element` type, e.g. table, form etc.
Elements can further implement other HTML interfaces, e.g. `HTMLElement`, `HTMLTableElement`, etc.
HTML elements can be manipulated through the DOM by editing the properties of the interface they implement.
Notable objects:

1. `window`, `window.onload` etc.
2. `document`, `document.getElementById()` etc.
3. `Element.innerHTML`, `HTMLElement.style` etc.

### Virtual DOM

[link](https://blog.logrocket.com/virtual-dom-react/)

Implementing react FC in raw JS, it might look like `() => <div><button/><button/></div>`. Now if we rerender the first button due to state change,
the second button will get rerendered also. Virtual DOM tackles this by determining what has changed and only updates the parts of the DOM that changed.

1. Initial Virtual DOM: React creates a replica of the actual DOM tree, from the root element all the way down.
2. Diffing (Reconciliation): say state changed. React does DFS to traverse the virtual DOM and compare it with the snapshot of the previous virtual DOM.
   It then creates a list of differences. Differences do not just mean dirty flag, i.e. if parent component classname changes the diff is only the classname,
   children is not automatically assumed to be diffed (it will check the child also).
3. Render: React used ReactDOM to update the actual DOM.

This has some problems:

1. Large DOM: very big blog with a clock at the top. Every second the clock updates, so every second React diffs the entire huge blog DOM tree.
   1. [No library]: make the clock a separate component, so only the clock is diffed with itself.
   2. [million js]: Block Virtual DOM, million does static analysis to identify dynamic parts, create an edit map. Only diff the dynamic parts.
2. Shared state: 2 deeply nested child components need to share the same state
   1. [No library]: prop drilling, pass the state down to the children, `useEffect` listen to prop change. Causes rerenders at every level.
   2. [No library]: context, create a provider at the top, `useContext` at the bottom. Causes rerenders of all children of context provider also.
      can `useMemo` static components to avoid this.
   3. [Redux]: single giant state store. actually uses context under the hood but is opimized so only updated components rerender (the context never changes).
   4. [recoil]: atoms and selectors. atoms = state, selectors listen to the atoms/other selectors, when upstream update selector updates

Additional notes:

- React and JSX: `const child = <Child/>` does not actually render child. it is equivalent to `child = React.createElement(Child, null, null);`.
- `createElement` returns a new object. Thus comparing the old child to new will always fail
- if `memo`d (`React.memo(Child)`), object equality passes, so child is not rerendered.

```js
function Parent() {
  const Elem = <Child />; // Elem is different each rerender.
  return <div>{Elem}</div>;
}
```

### Hooks overview

1. `useState`: `const [count, setCount] = useState(0);`, states + rerender.
2. `useEffect`:
   1. Usage: `useEffect(() => { console.log(count); return ()  => cleanup(); }, [count]);`.
   2. Trigger: After every render (mount + rerender). Functionally similar to `componentDidMount` + `componentDidUpdate`.
   3. Cleanup: optional, have the callback return a function to run, as per `componentWillUnmount`.
   4. Dependency array: optional, if present, only trigger callback when dependency (state or props) change (check via `===`)
3. `useContext`: explained later
4. `useReducer`: basically redux.
5. `useMemo`: `const cachedValue = useMemo(calculateValue, dependencies)`, memoizes results by dependencies like `useEffect`.
   - useful to avoid expensive function rerunning.
6. `useCallback`: `const cachedFn = useCallback(fn, dependencies)`, avoids running `fn` unless dependencies update (similar to `useEffect`)
   - useful when `cachedFn` is a dependency e.g. `useEffect(..., [cachedFn])`. `fn` changes every rerender but not `cachedFn`.
   - like `useMemo` but instead of returning a value return a function.
7. `useRef`: reference a value that does not impact rendering.
   - value stored across rerenders, on change does not trigger rerender. useful e.g. for storing hidden counter.
   - dom manipulation: `<input ref={inputRef} />`, `inputRef.current` becomes the DOM node of `input`. Can use `focus()`, `scrollIntoView()` etc.
   - note that dom manipulation is no longer react, might cause unexpected issues (remove DOM node that react still thinks exists)

```js
// init = optional initializer function, returns initial state. init only run once.
// initialArg supplied as argument to init. if initialArg no need arguments, can just set initialArg = null.
const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialArg, init);
function reducer(state, action) {
  // if action == ... switch case
  return [state, dispatch]; // state is initialArg initially.
}
// onclick={() => dispatch(action)}
```

### Context

1. Creating context: `const MyContext = React.createContext(defaultValue);`, this can be exported and imported elsewhere.
2. Providing context: `<MyContext.Provider value={/* some value */}>{consumers}</MyContext.Provider>`. Update its value here. Closest provider is used.
3. Using context: `const value = useContext(MyContext);`, in child component.

### Lifecycle order

React lifecycles (class methods) are split into 3 phases: mount, update, unmount.

1. [Mounting] `constructor()` -> `componentWillMount()` -> `getDerivedStateFromProps(props, state)`: Pre render.
2. [Mounting] `render()` -> `componentDidMount()`: render + post processing
3. [Updating] `shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps, nextState)` -> `componentWillUpdate()`: pre rerender. `shouldComponentUpdate` can be used to avoid rerendering unnecessarily.
4. [Updating] rerender -> `componentDidUpdate()`: post update
5. [Unmounting] `componentWillUnmount()`: cleanup, allows you to cancel timers, clear data structures etc.

### Bubbling

- When an event happens on an element, that event is also passed to its parents.
- button in a div, onclick event bubbled to div also.
- `event.target` is element where the event actually happened.
- `event.stopPropagation` prevents this from happening.
- `event.preventDefault` does not stop bubbling. It is used for disabling default actions (e.g. toggling checkboxes)
