# React notes

## Rendering

Causes rerenders:

1. `state` change: whole component rerenders including children components(**CHILDREN PROP WILL NOT RERENDER**)
2. parent rerenders: child also rerenders.
3. `context` changes: all components that `useContext` it will rerender.

Does not cause rerenders:

1. `props` change: unless `useEffect` dependencies have it. Usually still updates since parent update, child updates.

Preventing rerenders:

1. instead of wrapping expensive component, take in the component as children prop. children prop will not rerender.
   - `ExpensiveChild2` is owned by `root`, not `Parent`. `Parent` rerender will not affect it.

```js
//root.js
<Parent>
<ExpensiveChild2/>
</Parent>
// Parent.js
<div>
  <ExpensiveChild /> // rerenders when parent div rerenders
  {children} // does not rerender.
</div>
```

2. `React.memo` (previously `shouldComponentUpdate`): `const ChildMemo = React.Memo(Child); <ChildMemo/>`, only rerenders if props change.
   - Can provide function to check if props changed: `React.Memo(Child, (prevProps, NextProps) => true)`

## Document Object Model (DOM)

The DOM is a interface for HTML documents. It is not specific to JS.
It represents all objects in the page as `Node`s. Different `Node` have different `Element` type, e.g. table, form etc.
Elements can further implement other HTML interfaces, e.g. `HTMLElement`, `HTMLTableElement`, etc.
HTML elements can be manipulated through the DOM by editing the properties of the interface they implement.
Notable objects:

1. `window`, `window.onload` etc.
2. `document`, `document.getElementById()` etc.
3. `Element.innerHTML`, `HTMLElement.style` etc.

## Virtual DOM

[link](https://blog.logrocket.com/virtual-dom-react/)

Implementing react FC in raw JS, it might look like `() => <div><button/><button/></div>`. Now if we rerender the first button due to state change,
the second button will get rerendered also. Virtual DOM tackles this by determining what has changed and only updates the parts of the DOM that changed.
**Reconciliation: syncing VDOM with DOM**

1. Render phase: React creates a replica of the actual DOM tree, from the root element all the way down.
2. Diffing: say state changed. renderer changes the VDOM. React does DFS to traverse the virtual DOM and compare it with the snapshot of the previous virtual DOM.
   It then creates a list of differences. Differences do not just mean dirty flag, i.e. if parent component classname changes the diff is only the classname,
   children is not automatically assumed to be diffed (it will check the child also).
3. Commit phase: React uses ReactDOM to update the actual DOM.

**React Fiber Reconciler**

1. Allows for pausing and resuming of rendering, different priority levels.
2. replaces the synchronous react 15 stack reconciler (all at once on main stack). enables `Suspense`, concurrent mode.
3. A fiber is an object representing a component, its input + output. `type` = component/string. `child`: other fibers. basically old VDOM node.

React rules:

1. if element changes (`p` to `h1`), entire tree rebuild, does not reconcile children.
2. if only attribute change (props, css properties), only those changes are applied to DOM. also recurses on children.

This has some problems:

1. Large DOM: very big blog with a clock at the top. Every second the clock updates, so every second React diffs the entire huge blog DOM tree.
   1. [No library]: make the clock a separate component, so only the clock is diffed with itself.
   2. [million js]: Block Virtual DOM, million does static analysis to identify dynamic parts, create an edit map. Only diff the dynamic parts.
   3. [svelte]: Reactive programming, declare code that should rerun from dependency change
      - add `$$invalidate(componentName, newValue)` component call on state change at compile time. variables dependent on variables use `$: b = a + 1`.
2. Shared state: 2 deeply nested child components need to share the same state
   1. [No library]: lifting state up: prop drilling, pass the state down to the children, `useEffect` listen to prop change. Causes rerenders at every level.
   2. [No library]: context, create a provider at the top, `useContext` at the bottom. Causes rerenders of all children of context provider also.
      can `useMemo` static components to avoid this.
   3. [Redux]: single giant state store. actually uses context under the hood but is opimized so only updated components rerender (the context never changes).
   4. [recoil]: atoms and selectors. atoms = state, selectors listen to the atoms/other selectors, when upstream update selector updates

Additional notes:

- React and JSX: `const child = <Child/>` does not actually render child. it is equivalent to `child = React.createElement(Child, null, null);`.
- `createElement` returns a new object, aka element: `{type: "button", props: {color: blue, children: "text"}}`. Thus comparing the old child to new will always fail
- if `memo`d (`React.memo(Child)`), object equality passes, so child is not rerendered.
- `key` prop is used to identify elements of an array. Duplicate key might cause wrong element to be updated. No key provided, react uses array index as key.
  - same component, same `key`, assumed to be same, state is preserved: `bool ? <Comp f={bool} key={1}/> : <Comp f={bool} key={1}/>`, change `bool` state `Comp` state preserved.
- if we push at the start of an array without key prop, e.g. `3 1 2`, all 3 elements rerender. if key is set properly react notices only element `3` changed.

```js
function Parent() {
  const Elem = <Child />; // Elem is different each rerender.
  return <div>{Elem}</div>;
}
```

## Hooks overview

1. `useState`: `const [count, setCount] = useState(0);`, states + rerender.
2. `useEffect`: runs side effects after render.
   1. Usage: `useEffect(() => { console.log(count); return ()  => cleanup(); }, [count]);`.
   2. Trigger: After every render (mount + rerender). Functionally similar to `componentDidMount` + `componentDidUpdate`.
   3. Cleanup: optional, have the callback return a function to run, as per `componentWillUnmount`.
   4. Dependency array: optional, if present, only trigger callback when dependency (state or props) change (check via `===`)
3. `useContext`: explained later
4. `useReducer`: basically redux. ` const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);`, `reducer = (state, action) => newstate`.
5. `useMemo`: `const cachedValue = useMemo(calculateValue, dependencies)`, memoizes results by dependencies like `useEffect`.
   - useful to avoid expensive function rerunning.
   - to memoize components by props use `const MemComponent = React.memo(Component, (prevProps, nextProps) => true)`.
6. `useCallback`: `const cachedFn = useCallback(fn, dependencies)`, avoids running `fn` unless dependencies update (similar to `useEffect`)
   - useful when `cachedFn` is a dependency e.g. `useEffect(..., [cachedFn])`. `fn` changes every rerender but not `cachedFn`.
   - like `useMemo` but instead of returning a value return a function.
7. `useRef`: reference a value that does not impact rendering.
   - value stored across rerenders, on change does not trigger rerender. useful e.g. for storing hidden counter. value persist across rerender.
   - dom manipulation: `<input ref={inputRef} />`, `inputRef.current` becomes the DOM node of `input`. Can use `focus()`, `scrollIntoView()` etc.
   - note that dom manipulation is no longer react, might cause unexpected issues (remove DOM node that react still thinks exists)

```js
// init = optional initializer function, returns initial state. init only run once.
// initialArg supplied as argument to init. if initialArg no need arguments, can just set initialArg = null.
const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialArg, init);
function reducer(state, action) {
  // if action == ... switch case
  return [state, dispatch]; // state is initialArg initially.
}
// onclick={() => dispatch(action)}
```

## Context

1. Creating context: `const MyContext = React.createContext(defaultValue);`, this can be exported and imported elsewhere.
2. Providing context: `<MyContext.Provider value={/* some value */}>{consumers}</MyContext.Provider>`. Update its value here. Closest provider is used.
3. Using context: `const value = useContext(MyContext);`, in child component.

## Lifecycle order

React lifecycles (class methods) are split into 3 phases: mount, update, unmount.

1. [Mounting] `constructor()` -> `componentWillMount()` -> `getDerivedStateFromProps(props, state)`: Pre render.
2. [Mounting] `render()` -> `componentDidMount()`: render + post processing
3. [Updating] `shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps, nextState)` -> `componentWillUpdate()`: pre rerender. `shouldComponentUpdate` can be used to avoid rerendering unnecessarily.
4. [Updating] rerender -> `componentDidUpdate()`: post update
5. [Unmounting] `componentWillUnmount()`: cleanup, allows you to cancel timers, clear data structures etc.
