# Array

## Sliding Window

[Minimum Window Substring](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-window-substring/) O(N^2), S(N): Given a string, find the smallest substring containing all characters of the original string.

1. Create hashmap of all characters, init to 0.
2. sliding window left to right, move ptr right until all characters are in window.
3. if all characers are in window, move ptr left until not all characters are in window.

## 2 pointers

[Sort Colours](https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-colors) O(N), S(1): Sort an array of size n in place (no extra space). Array elements are 0, 1, 2.

1. **Dutch National Flag** algo: Create 3 pointers, low, mid, high.
2. all 0's are before low, all 2's are after high.
3. iterate mid left to right.
4. if mid == 0, swap mid and low, increment low and mid.
5. if mid == 2, swap mid and high, decrement high.
6. if mid == 1, increment mid.

[Container With Most Water](https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water/description/) O(N), S(1): Given n non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an , where each represents a line of height ai, find 2 lines which form the walls of the container with the biggest volume.

1. start = 0, end = n.
2. if start \< end, increment start, else decrement end.
3. calculate `area = min(height[start], height[end]) \* (end - start)`.

## 3SUM

[3Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/3sum/) O(N^2), S(1): Given an array nums of n integers, are there elements a, b, c in nums such that a + b + c = 0? Find all unique triplets in the array which gives the sum of zero.

1. basically 2SUM where a + b = k, k = -c.
2. iterate a
3. iterate b from a + 1 to end
4. iterate c from b + 1 to end
5. if a + b + c == 0, add to result

## 100 prisoners problem

100 numbered prisoners must find their own numbers in 100 lockers, but they can only open 50, cannot communicate with others.

1. Prisoner 10 opens locker 10
2. if the number matches, he is done
3. if not, he opens the locker of that number.
4. in order for him to fail, the permutation must be a cycle of size > 50.
